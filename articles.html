                    <h3>WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE ACHIEVED AGAINST PLAN IN CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE</h3>
                    <p>The maximum percentage achieved against the planned schedule in construction projects can vary widely depending on various factors such as project size, complexity, type of construction, and external constraints. It is challenging to define a specific maximum percentage as it can differ from project to project.
In general, a well-managed construction project aims to achieve a high level of schedule performance, ideally aiming for completion within the planned timeframe. However, it is not uncommon for projects to experience some level of schedule variance due to unforeseen circumstances, changes in scope, weather conditions, or other factors beyond the project team's control.
Typically, construction projects aim to achieve a schedule performance percentage of 90% or higher. This means that at least 90% of the planned tasks and milestones are completed within the scheduled timeframe. However, it's important to note that achieving 100% adherence to the planned schedule is rare in practice due to the dynamic nature of construction projects and the potential for unforeseen delays or disruptions.
Ultimately, the goal is to minimize schedule deviations and ensure that the project is completed as close to the planned schedule as possible. Effective project management, proactive planning, continuous monitoring, and timely interventions can help improve schedule performance and maximize the percentage achieved against the planned schedule.
if construction is affected due to heavy flood, damages has been claimed by insurance. it is possible to claim the extended stay with compensation for claim..

<h3>Difference between virtual completion and entire completion certificate. which one to be considered for project completion date</h3>
                    <p>Virtual Completion and Entire Completion Certificate are two different concepts related to project completion in the construction industry. Here's an explanation of each and their implications for project completion dates:
Virtual Completion: Virtual Completion refers to a situation where the contractor declares the project as complete based on the fulfillment of specific milestones, completion of major work components, or achievement of substantial performance, even if there are minor outstanding works or deficiencies remaining. It is often done to facilitate the handover and occupancy of the project while allowing for the resolution of minor issues post-completion.
Virtual Completion is typically accompanied by the issuance of a Virtual Completion Certificate, which acknowledges that the project has reached a stage where it can be used for its intended purpose, subject to the completion of outstanding items.
Entire Completion Certificate: The Entire Completion Certificate, also known as the Final Completion Certificate, is issued when all works on the project, including any outstanding items or deficiencies, have been satisfactorily completed as per the contract requirements and specifications. It signifies that the project has achieved full completion and is ready for final acceptance by the client or project owner.
When it comes to determining the project completion date, the Entire Completion Certificate is generally considered the official document. It signifies that all contractual obligations have been fulfilled, all works are completed as per the contract, and the project is ready for final handover and acceptance.

<h3>Client can deduct the Liquated damaged amount on each bill if any delay, same delay is not evaluated. is it advisable.? even it is not mentioned in contract</h3>
                    <p>if the deduction of liquidated damages on each bill for any delay is not specifically mentioned in the contract, it may not be advisable for the client to deduct such amounts without proper evaluation and agreement between the parties. Here are a few points to consider:
Contractual Provisions: Review the contract carefully to determine if it includes provisions related to the deduction of liquidated damages on each bill for delays. If there is no specific provision allowing such deductions, it may not be within the client's rights to make these deductions unilaterally.
Evaluation of Delays: It is important to properly evaluate and determine the cause and responsibility for any delays. This evaluation should be done in accordance with the contract provisions, which may outline procedures for assessing delays and determining liability. Without a proper evaluation process, the deductions may be arbitrary and potentially disputed by the contractor.
Fairness and Equitability: Deducting liquidated damages on each bill without an evaluation of delays may be seen as unfair or unjust. It is important to maintain a fair and balanced approach in resolving disputes and administering contractual obligations.
Open Communication: Engage in open and transparent communication with the client to address any concerns regarding delays and potential liquidated damages. Discuss the contract provisions, project progress, and any mitigating factors that may have contributed to the delays.

<h3>if government authority stopped the work due to non compliance towards safety, delay attribute to client or contractor</h3>
                    <p>The attribution of delay when the government authority stops the work due to non-compliance towards safety can vary depending on the specific circumstances and the terms of the contract. However, here are some general considerations:
Contractual Provisions: Review the contract to determine if it addresses situations where work is stopped by government authorities due to non-compliance with safety requirements. Look for provisions related to force majeure, suspension of work, or government intervention. These provisions may outline the responsibilities and consequences for both the client and the contractor in such situations.
Non-Compliance Responsibility: Assess whether the non-compliance towards safety was due to the contractor's actions or failure to meet the specified safety standards. If the contractor is responsible for the non-compliance, the delay may be attributed to the contractor.
Client's Obligations: Consider whether the client has fulfilled their obligations to provide a safe working environment and communicated the necessary safety requirements to the contractor. If the client failed to fulfill their obligations in ensuring compliance with safety regulations, the delay may be attributed to the client.
Mitigation Efforts: Evaluate whether the contractor took prompt and reasonable steps to address the non-compliance and resolve the safety issues. Document any actions taken by the contractor to mitigate the delay and demonstrate their commitment to safety.
In situations where work is stopped due to non-compliance with safety, it is advisable for both parties to engage in open communication, assess the specific circumstances, and seek legal advice if necessary. The contract terms and the governing laws of the contract jurisdiction will also play a significant role in determining the attribution of delay and the associated responsibilities.

<h3>the contractor stopped the work due to non payment, after some period, contract duration is expired as per agreement. after some time, client ask contractor to complete the work by paying the balance amount, contractor denied to do the work becuase of contract expired. is it right</h3>
                    <p>In the scenario, where the contract duration has expired and the client asks the contractor to complete the work by paying the balance amount, the contractor's decision to deny the work due to the contract expiry is a reasonable position to take. Here are some points to consider:
Contractual Obligations: Review the terms of the contract to determine the rights and obligations of both parties after the contract duration has expired. Check if there are any provisions related to the completion of work after the contract expiry or provisions addressing the consequences of work not being completed within the specified contract duration.
Time is of the Essence: Consider whether the contract explicitly states that time is of the essence. If the contract contains such a provision, it emphasizes the importance of completing the work within the specified contract duration, and the contractor's decision to deny the work after the contract expiry aligns with that provision.
Change in Circumstances: Evaluate any changes in circumstances that may have occurred during the period after the contract expiry. Factors such as market conditions, availability of resources, and changes in costs may affect the feasibility and viability of completing the work as initially agreed upon.
Contractor's Rights: Contractors have the right to expect timely payment for work completed and to work within the agreed-upon contract duration. If the contractor has not been paid in accordance with the payment terms outlined in the contract, it is reasonable for them to deny further work until the outstanding payments are resolved.
